# Welcome to SmorphiBlockly
SmorphiBlockly is a visual graphical programming editor for Smorphi robots. It is based on Google's [Blockly][1] and Carlos Pereira Atencio's[Ardublockly][2]. Provide static type language blocks and code generators for programming on Smorphi robots. It is the perfect software to get you started into coding and STEM robotics.


## Features
* Programming Smorphi with visually drag and drop code blocks.
* Uploads the code using Arduino IDE to Smorphi Master board.
* Useful "code block warnings".
* Compatible with any Smorphi robots, Arduino and ESP32 related boards.
* Works on Windows / Linux.

SmorphiBlockly is still under development and a few features are not yet implemented.

Currently tested under Windows with Python 2.7 and 3.9 and in Linux with Python 2.7.


## Cloning the repository
Please note that there are submodules in the repository that need initialisation. So, to correctly clone the Smorphi-Blockly repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/roarLab/Smorphi-Blockly.git

```
Or download the zip file of the repository and unzip the file on your desired local storage space.

## Running
The desktop application is available for Windows/Linux and runs as a stand-alone executable.

You will also need the [Arduino IDE version 1.6.x or higher][2].

```
cd Smorphi-Blockly/arduexec/server

```
Run ```start.exe```
